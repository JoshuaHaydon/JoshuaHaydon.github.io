		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Joshua Haydon, and I am a student at Southwestern College. I am in a Hypertext Markup Language Programming class and this website was created for my class project. I have one more class after this and then I will graduate with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Operations Technology. I plan on continuing my education in a master’s program after graduation. </p>
		<p>I am currently a full-time member of the Kansas Air National Guard and have been serving for 12 years. I specialize in enterprise networking and cyber security.  I have been married for five years and have two kids, a boy, and a girl. I enjoy staying fit and working on projects around my property. Most of my free time outside of work evolves around my family and friends. </p>
		<h2>About My Wife</h2>
		<p>My beautiful wife's name is Danielle. We have been together for eight years and married for five. Danielle is a 6th grade math teacher at Andover Middle School here in Kansas. Danielle is currently finishing her master’s in education and is a very talented photographer. Check out her photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thosehaydonbabes">Instagram</a>.</p>

<h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
My name is Joshua Haydon and I am a student at Southwestern College. I am in a Hypertext Markup Language Programming class and this website was created for my class project.
I have one more class after this and then I will graduate with my bachelors of science degree in Computer Operations Technology. I plan on continueing my education in a masters program after graduation.
I am currently a full time member of the Kansas Air National Guard and have been serving for 12 years. I specilize in enterprise netowrking and cyber security. 
I have been married for five years and have two kids, one boy and one girl. I enjoy staying fit working on projects around my property. Most of my free time outside of work evolves around my family and friends.
